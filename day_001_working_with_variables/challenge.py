#Band Name Generator
#Goal: Create a mini "band name generator"
# that asks the user for the name of the city they grew up in
# and their first pet's name. It then combines these names to generate their band name.

print("Welcome to the band name generator")
city = input("What is the name of the city you grew up in?\n")
pet = input("What is the name of your first pet?\n")
print("You band name will be '" + city + " " + pet +"'")

#This challenge is a simple exercise to practice string concatenation.
#The user is asked to input two strings, and the program outputs a new string that combines the two inputs.
#The program uses the input() function to get the user's input and the print() function to display the output.
#The + operator is used to concatenate the strings.
#The program is structured with a welcome message, input prompts, and the final output.
